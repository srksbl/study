		<p>BMS has become really bad it has removed the option to purchase filmy pass which was a very useful offer for movie buffs. We can't even purchase it from the help page it says error whenever we try to purchase it. I hope it is brought back. Otherwise the prices of <b><i>tickets skyrocketing</i></b> now make no sen</P>
